While the mastermind game is single player but the player can pick between being the codecreator or codebreaker. This game offers a very basic AI that can take random guesses on the secret code, and will make very minor adjustments based on feedback. The AI is not currently in a good state and is very basic.

Both game offers a small set of instructions on how to play before the start of the game.
